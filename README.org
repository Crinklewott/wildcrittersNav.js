This UserScript should allow you to navigate WildCritters pools and
images in a slightly nicer fashion...

When viewing an image, if you click it, you get a fullscreen
image. Images will remain fullscreen until you click one again.

When you are looking at a pool with multiple images, you can navigate
between images with the arrow keys.

I'm kinda sad that this isn't default functionality, but hey! At least
it wasn't too difficult to add.
